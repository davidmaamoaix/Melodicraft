# Melodicraft
A program that turns a midi file into a minecraft save.

## Warning
- Do NOT be facetious and comment on the naming of this project. I am trying hard to be as original as posssible, thus the seemingly random name.
- There is a special place in hell for people who comment "yo ya retarted playing minecraft in 2018".
- Yes K-pop is gay.

## Dependencies
Nothing here to show (yet).
